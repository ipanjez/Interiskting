# RMI Accordion State Persistence - Refactored Implementation

## Overview
The accordion state persistence system has been significantly improved to provide more reliable, robust, and feature-rich state management for the RMI assessment interface.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- **localStorage Availability Check**: Added `isLocalStorageAvailable()` function to detect if localStorage is supported
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation of input parameters and stored data
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to work even if localStorage is unavailable
- **Corruption Recovery**: Automatic cleanup of corrupted localStorage data

### 2. Improved Reliability
- **Safe Data Access**: Helper functions `getOpenAccordionsFromStorage()` and `setOpenAccordionsToStorage()` handle all localStorage operations safely
- **DOM Element Validation**: Verifies accordion elements exist before attempting to restore their state
- **Cleanup Mechanism**: `cleanupAccordionState()` removes references to accordion elements that no longer exist in the DOM

### 3. Dynamic Content Support
- **Mutation Observer**: Automatically detects when new accordion elements are added to the DOM
- **Dynamic Restoration**: Newly added accordions automatically have their saved state restored
- **Adaptive Monitoring**: Observes the entire document body for accordion-related changes

### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- **Debug Information**: `getAccordionStateDebugInfo()` provides comprehensive state information
- **Detailed Logging**: Improved console logging with more contextual information
- **State Inspection**: Easy access to current accordion states for troubleshooting

## Core Functions

### `initializeAccordionStateMemory()`
- Sets up the entire accordion state management system
- Cleans up any invalid states from previous sessions
- Restores saved accordion states
- Initializes the mutation observer for dynamic content

### `saveAccordionState(elementId, state)`
- Saves accordion open/close state to localStorage
- Validates input parameters and localStorage availability
- Prevents duplicate entries and handles state transitions properly
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

### `restoreAccordionState()`
- Reads saved states from localStorage
- Validates and restores accordion states with proper timing
- Handles missing elements gracefully
- Provides comprehensive restoration reporting

### `cleanupAccordionState()`
- Removes references to accordion elements that no longer exist
- Prevents localStorage bloat and invalid state references
- Automatically called during restoration if missing elements are detected

### Helper Functions

#### `getOpenAccordionsFromStorage()`
- Safely retrieves accordion state array from localStorage
- Handles JSON parsing errors gracefully
- Returns empty array if data is corrupted or missing

#### `setOpenAccordionsToStorage(accordions)`
- Safely saves accordion state array to localStorage
- Validates array data before saving
- Handles storage quota and access errors

#### `isLocalStorageAvailable()`
- Tests localStorage availability and functionality
- Handles browser restrictions and quota issues
- Returns boolean indicating localStorage usability

#### `getAccordionStateDebugInfo()`
- Returns comprehensive debug information including:
  - localStorage availability status
  - Currently stored accordion IDs
  - DOM elements that are currently open
  - List of all accordion elements with their states

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
The system works automatically once initialized. Accordion states are saved and restored without any manual intervention.

### Debugging
```javascript
// Get current state information
const debugInfo = RMI.getAccordionStateDebugInfo();
console.log('Current accordion state:', debugInfo);

// Clear all saved states (useful for testing)
RMI.clearAccordionState();

// Manually clean up invalid states
RMI.cleanupAccordionState();

// Force restoration of saved states
RMI.restoreAccordionState();
```

### Testing localStorage
```javascript
// Check if localStorage is available
if (window.RMI && typeof RMI.getAccordionStateDebugInfo === 'function') {
    const debug = RMI.getAccordionStateDebugInfo();
    console.log('localStorage available:', debug.localStorageAvailable);
}
```

## Integration with Bootstrap

### Event Handlers
The system integrates seamlessly with Bootstrap's collapse events:
- `show.bs.collapse`: Automatically saves 'open' state
- `hide.bs.collapse`: Automatically saves 'close' state

### Timing Considerations
- Uses appropriate timeouts to work with Bootstrap's animation timing
- Avoids conflicts with Bootstrap's internal state management
- Ensures proper sequencing of DOM updates and state saving

## Error Recovery

### Automatic Cleanup
- Invalid accordion IDs are automatically removed during restoration
- Corrupted localStorage data is cleared and reset
- Missing DOM elements don't prevent other accordions from being restored

### Fallback Behavior
- If localStorage is unavailable, the system logs warnings but continues to function
- If restoration fails, the system attempts to clean up and continue
- All errors are logged but don't break the overall interface

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Storage
- Only stores accordion IDs that are actually open
- Removes closed accordion IDs to minimize storage usage
- Uses JSON for efficient serialization

### Minimal DOM Queries
- Caches jQuery objects where possible
- Uses efficient selectors for accordion detection
- Minimizes DOM traversal during restoration

### Optimized Timing
- Uses appropriate delays to work with Bootstrap animations
- Batches restoration operations for better performance
- Avoids unnecessary state saves for elements already in the correct state

## Browser Compatibility

### localStorage Support
- Works in all modern browsers (IE8+)
- Gracefully handles private browsing mode restrictions
- Detects and handles storage quota limitations

### MutationObserver Support
- Uses MutationObserver in browsers that support it (IE11+)
- Gracefully degrades in older browsers
- Provides fallback notification when not available

## Testing and Validation

### Manual Testing
1. Open several accordions at different levels
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify that the same accordions are still open
4. Check browser console for any errors

### Debug Functions
```javascript
// Test the current state
RMI.getAccordionStateDebugInfo();

// Clear and test restoration
RMI.clearAccordionState();
// Manually open some accordions
// Refresh page and verify they stay closed

// Test cleanup
// Remove an accordion element from DOM
RMI.cleanupAccordionState();
// Verify invalid IDs are removed from storage
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Accordions don't restore**: Check browser console for localStorage errors
2. **State not saving**: Verify accordion elements have unique IDs
3. **Performance issues**: Check for excessive logging in production

### Debug Steps
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check console for RMI Script log messages
3. Use `RMI.getAccordionStateDebugInfo()` to inspect current state
4. Verify localStorage content in Application/Storage tab

### Reset State
If accordion state becomes corrupted, use:
```javascript
RMI.clearAccordionState();
```

This will remove all saved states and close all currently open accordions.
